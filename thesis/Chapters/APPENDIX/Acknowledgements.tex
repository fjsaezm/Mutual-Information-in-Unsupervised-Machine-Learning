I would like to thank my tutor, Professor Nicolás Pérez de la Blanca, who has greatly guided me in this work, patiently answering my questions and doubts about the topic.

I would also like to thank my friends for supporting me not only reading this work and providing feedback, but also during the whole bachelor's degree. Specially, thank you to my girlfriend Isabel, who has been my solid ground and has pushed me to be constant and resilient.  

Finally, I would like to thank my family, my very special, weird, but full of love family.

Thank you all.
