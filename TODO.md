# TODO

[x]  Change name ofto Contrastive Predictive coding
[x]  Change name to InfoNCE LOSS
[x]  Explain statistics and sufficient statistics
[x] Page 17 Graph refference not working
[x] Fix (link) in file: 1-Entropy-MI.tex (add ref)
[x] Ref at the end of generative models
[x] Add mode and unimodal/multimodal definitions 
[x] Page 30, revise "In fact..."
[] Donsker-Varadan representation Theorem
[x] Remove all the bound part in InfoNCE
[x] Distance metric learning https://www.nec-labs.com/uploads/images/Department-Images/MediaAnalytics/papers/nips16_npairmetriclearning.pdf
[x] Check if color of propositions is the same as the others
[x] Change the .0. numeration in defs/props etc
[] Neural networks introduction (resnet, data augmentation (give examples of data augmentations))
[x] Change `with tf.summary.record_if(should_record)` to TRUE for testing purposes. (didnt change)
[] Test batch size = 512/1024 more
[] Change to continuous val evaluation 
[] redo table
[] Say where we are executing (nvidia)
[] End Tensorboard explanation
